This project contains:

Matrix.java - a representation of a matrix with
the following operations: add(), sub(), mult(),
scalarMult(), copy(), transpose(),
changeEntry(), equals(), and toString(). These
operations are meant to demonstrate how to 
do them by hand, instead we are using a computer.

MatrixTest.java - a test client for Matrix.java

List.java - a list of objects, modified from pa1

Sparse.java - a representation of a sparse matrix
and further tests Matrix.java

ListTest.java - a test client for List.java

Makefile - makefile for pa3

README - README for pa3: contains all the
descriptions of the files and what they do.
